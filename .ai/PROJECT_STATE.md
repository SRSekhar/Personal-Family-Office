# Project State

## Project

- **Name:** PFO OS
- **Full Name:** Personal Family Office Operating System
- **Version:** 0.1.0
- **Status:** Active Development

## Current Milestone

**M1 — Technical Foundation**  
Status: Complete — repository bootstrap and CI are implemented and validated. Public-release safety decisions remain open.

## Current Work

- **Epic:** Analytics Engine
- **Status:** Three deterministic calculator capabilities are implemented; continue with net worth and asset allocation.

## Foundation Verified

- Repository, GitHub Flow, AI onboarding, architecture, and project documentation established.
- Configuration-driven PowerShell bootstrap merged.
- CI uses a frozen pnpm lockfile.
- CI runs initialization, validation, doctor, WhatIf/no-overwrite/path-safety tests, lint, typecheck, build, and tests.
- Pull-request CI passed for the foundation and initial analytics capabilities.

## Implemented Calculator Capabilities

- CAGR calculation with input validation and edge-case tests.
- Annual compound-growth projection with explicit contribution timing, input validation, overflow checks, and tests.
- XIRR for dated cash flows using ACT/365 and bisection, with date/amount validation and explicit rejection of multi-sign-change cash-flow series.

These are mathematical utilities, not investment advice or guaranteed forecasts. XIRR currently supports cash-flow streams with exactly one sign change to avoid ambiguous roots.

## Next Deliverables

1. Implement net-worth and asset-allocation calculations using the existing domain models and explicit non-double-counting rules.
2. Complete a full-history secret and sensitive-data scan before any public release.
3. Decide the public framework/private application boundary and licensing model.
4. Validate one revenue hypothesis with real prospective users before investing in paid tiers.

## Blockers and Risks

- The GitHub repository is public; do not commit real financial data or private configuration.
- The repository does not yet have a valid open-source license.
- Historical repository content and commit metadata have not been fully scanned.
- The Anthropic application draft is prepared but has not been submitted.
- No revenue, customer demand, or product-market fit has been validated.
